# bagging_and_Random_Forest

Try both datasets, the Crabs data is well seperated whereas the PBC data is less so. The Y in Crabs is species, the Y in PBC is status. Please read the descriptions of each in the data description pdf.

For each data-set try the plain decision tree, Bagging (with tuning for parameters) and the Random forest (tune parameters here as well).

In addition, continue best practices of trying differnet data scalers, clean data etc.
